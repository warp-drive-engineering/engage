@warp-drive/project-blueprint
=========================

A project blueprint for highly optimized applications built with [Ember.js](https://emberjs.com/)

## ♥️ Features

> For planned but not yet released features see the [Roadmap](./ROADMAP.md)


## ♥️ Pre-Requisites

Using this blueprint requires a global ember-cli install.

We recommend installing and managing ember-cli via [volta](https://volta.sh/).

This blueprint also configures node and yarn usage via volta.

Install volta if required, then use volta to install ember-cli.

```cli
volta install ember-cli
```

## ♥️ Usage

```cli
ember new <my-app> --yarn -d <directory-name> -b @warp-drive/project-blueprint
```

Then switch into the new directory and start working!

```
cd <directory-name>
```
